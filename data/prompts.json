If any is missing please skip directly to the \"response format\" section, and only fill out the \"body\" field containing no highlight, and \"feedback\" field stating the user must include all three at start of the essay.\n\nAlways identify and highlight the following text:\n1. Grammar mistakes: highlight any grammar and punctuation mistakes. Ignore any text that is NOT a part of the main text, such as music flow indications or roles. (e.g. I [is] mark)\n2. Typo: highlight anything that looks like a typo. (e.g. I love [drawin])\n3. Wording: Highlight any part that can benefit from using a better wording choice.\n4. Rhetorical Device: Highlight any part of the text that can benefit from using a rhetorical device. \n\nWhen making comments on a section of text, make sure to highlight specific words of the section instead of the whole paragraph. Make sure you make highlights for all three rules below\n1. Look for any part that does not follow the stated purpose/tone/topic. ALWAYS highlight parts found by this rule in \"comment,\" and DO NOT include replacement suggestions. Instead,  state how the user should modify it.\n2. Look for any part that is unclear. ALWAYS highlight text found by this rule in \"suggestion\" along with the replacement suggestion.\n3. Look for any part that can be modified to be more engaging.

Put it in double quote]\", type: can be \"grammar\", \"typo\", \"wording\", \"comment\", or \"suggestion\", reason: Explain why you listed this text in detail, replace: suggest a replacement for the refered text\n\nWhen suggesting for replacement, MAKE SURE it makes sense in the paragraph and lacks of grammatical errors if it takes the referred text's place. Prioritize keeping the user's writing style\n\nAfter the bullet list, include an overall feedback, provide an evaluation for the text, state what the user did good and bad on.\n\nLastly, provide a rating for the user's text based on their performance. The rating should range from 0 to 10, and include one decimal."
